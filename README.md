# Edifier Gang Graduation Guestbook

Welcome to the Edifier Gang Graduation Guestbook repository! 
This mobile application was crafted for the Edifier Gang's Graduation Party (see repository collaborators for the gang's members), capturing the essence of the event and engaging guests in a lively competition.

### Main Features:
- **Post Submission**: Guests participating in the Guestbook, after having created their account can create and sumbit their posts, capturing both photos and text from any of the graduation party moments.
- **Like a Post**:  Registered guests can show their appreciation for a post by liking it. This feature allows users to interact with others' posts and increases angagement within the app.
- **Competition**: The top three submissions (most liked) can be awarded points by the organizers which in our case were added to the complete leaderboard kept during the party, which was filled with points from other events.
- **Live Projection**: A dedicated page displays the continuously updated top three posts and randomly selected posts from the guestbook. We chose to project this information on a wall live during the party.


### Note from Organizers
The main concept came up while we were thinking about what we could plan to make people know each other better. We did have many strangers among our guests, so getting to know each other by competing was a solution we really thought would make a difference. And it did! At least that's what we were told after the event concluded. From a total of around 50-60 guests, we managed to gather more than 80 posts in 3 hours, showing the acceptance our application had from the participants.

Moreover, we cut on costs of hiring a photographer, since all our guests did this job for us. We then gathered all the photos uploaded and extracted a collection that will remain with us from now on.

### Acknowledgements
A big thank you to all the guests who actively participatied by submitting posts and making the event truly special.
